# W3C Web API

!!!!**This repository is not yet public as we are working on it but will be made public shortly.**!!!!

The goal of this project is provide a JSON API to access W3C data.

The API is intended to be public and read-only.

## API documentation

The API is documented at [https://api-test.w3.org/doc](https://api-test.w3.org/doc).

## Feedback and contributions

The code of this API is not public because it is highly tied to the W3C database infrastructure and would expose sensitive information. However, we welcome feedback and strongly encourage people to submit issues [here](https://github.com/w3c/w3c-api/issues).
