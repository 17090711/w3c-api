# W3C API

**Disclaimer: The W3C API is currently under development and is not yet stable. It is subject to change at any time without prior notice. Use it at your own risk.**

The goal of this project is to provide a JSON API to access W3C data.

The W3C API is intended to be public and read-only.

## API documentation

The W3C API is documented at [https://w3c.github.io/w3c-api/](https://w3c.github.io/w3c-api/) and the details about the different endpoints are available at [https://api-test.w3.org/doc](https://api-test.w3.org/doc)

## Libraries

[Apiary](https://github.com/w3c/apiary) is a simple JavaScript library to leverage the W3C API.
This library is intended to be used from W3C pages: domain pages, group pages, personal pages, etc.
With Apiary, you can inject data that is retrieved using the W3C API, in a declarative way using *placeholders*.

See [the GitHub project](https://github.com/w3c/apiary) for more information.
Examples are also provided.

For using the W3C API with other langgages see the [list of libraries for working with JSON HAL](https://github.com/mikekelly/hal_specification/wiki/Libraries).

## Feedback and contributions

The code of this API is not public because it is highly tied to the W3C database infrastructure and would expose sensitive information. However, we welcome feedback and strongly encourage people to submit issues [here](https://github.com/w3c/w3c-api/issues).

You can also join the [W3C's IRC](http://www.w3.org/Project/IRC/) [#webapi](irc://irc.w3.org:6667/webapi) channel.
