# W3C Web API

!!!!**This repository is not yet public as we are working on it but will be made public shortly.**!!!!

The goal of this project is provide a JSON API to access W3C data.

The API is intended to be public and read-only.

**Disclaimer: The API is currently under development and is not yet stable. It is subject to change at any time without prior notice. Use it at your own risk.**

## API documentation

The API is documented at [https://w3c.github.io/w3c-api/](https://w3c.github.io/w3c-api/) and the details about the different routes are available at [https://api-test.w3.org/doc](https://api-test.w3.org/doc)

## JavaScript library

[Apiary](https://github.com/w3c/apiary) is a simple JavaScript library to leverage the W3C API.
This library is intended to be used from W3C pages: domain pages, group pages, personal pages, etc.
With Apiary, you can inject data that is retrieved using the W3C API, in a declarative way using *placeholders*.

See [the GitHub project](https://github.com/w3c/apiary) for more information.
Examples are also provided.

## Feedback and contributions

The code of this API is not public because it is highly tied to the W3C database infrastructure and would expose sensitive information. However, we welcome feedback and strongly encourage people to submit issues [here](https://github.com/w3c/w3c-api/issues).
